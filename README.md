## Introduction

This is a rewrite of heliamphora using golang. I mostly just got bored and decided to give go a shot. This is a mostly complete rewrite of heliamorpha except that, at the time of writing, it only supports USD. The config syntax has changed a bit too. The python version uses an ini style, this one uses yaml or json. Whichever you prefer.

Also, this seems to be about 75% faster than the python version so I'm very happy with that.

## Installation

To build this you'll need the following packages:

* github.com/bclicn/color
* github.com/olekukonko/tablewriter
* github.com/spf13/viper

## Configuration

The config file has been moved to `~/.heli.yaml`. Here is an example configuration:

```

You can get a full list of available crypto currencies on coinmarketcap.com or by running this command and looking at the `id` fields (requires [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)):

```
